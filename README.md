 # Weather App Test

This is a simple weather app test project that allows users to search for the current weather in a city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the city entered by the user.

## Make sure to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` in the README file with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key, and save it as `README.md` in the root directory of your project. This README file will provide basic instructions and information about your weather app test project.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to run the application.

2. In the search bar, enter the name of the city for which you want to check the weather.

3. Click the search button

4. The application will display the current weather for the entered city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.

## Files and Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application, which contains the structure of the web page and the input elements for city search.

- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout for the web page elements, including the weather card and search bar.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for fetching and displaying weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

- `images/`: This folder contains image files used in the application, including weather icons and the search icon.

## API Key

To use this application, you need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace the `apiKey` variable in the `script.js` file with your own API key.

## Credits

This project was created as a simple demonstration of fetching and displaying weather data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is not intended for production use and serves as a starting point for learning and experimentation.

Feel free to modify and enhance the project as needed for your purposes!
